# Online-Retail-Database-Management

PROJECT STATEMENT

Goals:

This project is an online shopping database system that will store information about the company’s resources, such as customers, accounts, products, orders and payments. The goal of this system is to create a single database that combines all of the data related to the online shopping activities.  For the purposes of this project, the authors have decided to use a hypothetical organization, which reflects real-world data needs and challenges of many companies selling products online.

Context and Importance of the System:

The company has its own website to sell products. Customers order products through the website. After customers select products, hey would like to buy and put products into their shopping carts, they can either login to check out if they are registered customers or check out as a guest if they are temporary customers.  After checkout, the company will track the status of the orders. Registered customers can also check their order’s status and order history when they log into their accounts, however temporary customers can only track their order status via tracking number and also through text and email updates from the company.

Scope of the Project:

This database will store data about every customer. Customer data includes their identification, address, contact information.  Other data includes orders information such as order date, shipping and delivery status, payment information such as price and payment dates, as well as collecting product reviews from the customers. The scope of this database will also include data about products such as identification, price, description, and product type categories.
